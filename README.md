# iliasvpn

A small, self-hosted web service that surfaces **login codes and login links**
from a Gmail inbox the instant they arrive — so you never have to dig through
your mail app to copy a one-time code again.

It watches two specific kinds of email and presents each as its own guided flow:

| Flow | What it shows | Source email |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **BlancVPN** | The 6-digit login **code** (plus install + login instructions and a "Новости" feed) | `support@blancvpn.com`, subject `… is your BlancVPN login code` |
| **Claude.ai** | The **secure login link** | `no-reply-*@mail.anthropic.com`, subject `Secure link to log in to Claude.ai` |
| **Новости** (News) | BlancVPN announcements | any sender at `blancvpn.org` |

All mail is read **server-side over IMAP** — credentials never reach the
browser. The frontend only ever talks to this app's own API routes.

> Naming: the repo is `ilias-vpn`; the running service is **iliasvpn**.

## How it works

```
Browser ──fetch──▶ /api/messages?category=…  ─┐
                   /api/message?category=&uid= │  (Next.js Node runtime)
                                               ▼
                                       lib/imap.ts  ──IMAP/TLS──▶  Gmail
```

- **`/api/messages?category=claude|blancvpn|news`** — searches the mailbox,
  extracts the code (BlancVPN) or login URL (Claude), and returns a lightweight
  JSON list (no raw HTML).
- **`/api/message?category=…&uid=…`** — returns the full body of one message on
  demand. The viewer renders it inside a **sandboxed iframe** (no scripts), and
  the endpoint refuses any UID whose sender doesn't match the category, so it
  can't be used to read unrelated inbox mail.
- The pages **poll** every few seconds, highlight a freshly-arrived code/link,
  and play a soft chime — so a code you just requested shows up on its own.

The login email shown in the instructions comes from the `EMAIL` (or
`LOGIN_EMAIL`) environment variable and is read on the server.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or `.env.local`) and fill it in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EMAIL` | ✅ | Gmail address to read; also shown in the login instructions. |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | ✅ | Gmail **App Password** (not the account password). |
| `IMAP` | ✅ | IMAP host, e.g. `imap.gmail.com`. |
| `IMAP_PORT` | – | Defaults to `993` (implicit TLS). |
| `IMAP_MAILBOX` | – | Defaults to `INBOX`. |
| `MAIL_LOOKBACK_DAYS` | – | How far back to search. Defaults to `30`. |
| `LOGIN_EMAIL` | – | Address shown in instructions. Defaults to `EMAIL`. |

### Getting a Gmail App Password

1. Enable 2-Step Verification on the Google account.
2. Go to <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>.
3. Create a password (e.g. named "iliasvpn") and paste the 16-character value
   into `EMAIL_PASSWORD`.
4. Make sure IMAP is enabled in Gmail → Settings → *Forwarding and POP/IMAP*.

---

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

If the env vars are missing, the site still renders the instructions and shows a
"почта не настроена" notice in place of the live codes.

```bash
npm run build && npm start   # production build
```

---

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, **New Project → Import** the repo (framework auto-detected as
   Next.js).
3. Add the environment variables from the table above in
   **Settings → Environment Variables**.
4. Deploy.

The API routes declare `runtime = "nodejs"` (imapflow needs real TCP/TLS
sockets, so the Edge runtime won't work) and `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` so mail
is never cached.

  api/message/route.ts  Single full-email endpoint
lib/
  imap.ts               IMAP connect / search / parse (server-only)
  extract.ts            Pull code / login URL out of an email
  config.ts             Env-var reading
  install-links.ts      BlancVPN download links

## Notes & limitations

- Built for **one mailbox** (a personal helper). There is no auth on the web
  app itself — deploy it somewhere private, or add access control before
  exposing it publicly, since anyone who can open the page can see codes.
- Codes/links are matched by sender + subject; if those email templates change,
  update the rules in `lib/imap.ts` / `lib/extract.ts`.
- Only `INBOX` is searched by default (archived mail is skipped).
